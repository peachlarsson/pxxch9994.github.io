# Simple single-page site

This repository now contains a minimal single-page website for Peach Larsson.

Files added:
- `index.html` — the page markup
- `style.css` — minimal responsive styling with a dark theme toggle
- `script.js` — small client-side script for theme toggling and a mock contact handler

How to use
1. Open `index.html` in the browser to preview locally.
2. To publish via GitHub Pages, make sure the repository is named `peachlarsson.github.io` and Pages is set to serve from the `main` branch.

Customize
- Edit the content in `index.html` and `style.css` to match your branding.
- Replace the contact form behavior in `script.js` with a real backend or a form service if you want to receive messages.
